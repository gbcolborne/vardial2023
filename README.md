# Multi-label Dialect Identification

This repo will contain experimental code on multi-label dialect
identification, developed for a paper entitled "Dialect and Variant
Identification as a Multi-Label Classification Task: A Proposal Based
on Near-Duplicate Analysis" (Bernier-Colborne, Goutte, and LÃ©ger,
2023), which was accepted for presentation at the VarDial 2023
workshop.

The code will be made available shortly.
